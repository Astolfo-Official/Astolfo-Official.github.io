This is my personal website, where I collect academic information for myself. I obtained my B.S. degree from [Universitas Amoiensis](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) and am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/).

I am currently working on computational polariton dynamics. If you are interested in this field, please visit our group website [Tao E. Li Group](https://www.taoeli.org/) and consider joining us! Our group is looking for new graduate student for 26 Fall now!!!
